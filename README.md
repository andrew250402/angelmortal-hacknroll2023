Hack n Roll 2023 submission!
The code requires a csv file to work.
There are 3 columns in the csv file with the headers (player, mortal, angel)
The player, mortal and angel columns are filled by telegrams handles (username)

For instance:

player, mortal, angel

user1, user2, user3

this row implies that user 1 is a mortal of user 2 and is also an angel of user 3
